2025-10-01 14:26:35.865474: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:194] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

Unique mods in first 1000 samples: {'OOK'}
Step 2: Filtering indices based on target modulations and SNRs...
Sample 0: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 1: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 2: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 3: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 4: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 5: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 6: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 7: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 8: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 9: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 10: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 11: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 12: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 13: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 14: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 15: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 16: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 17: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 18: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
Sample 19: mod=OOK, snr=[-20]
